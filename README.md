# Flexisaf Internship Challenge
Welcome to the Flexisaf Internship challenge. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build a shopping list application using React. This challenge is based on this excellent React book and tutorial http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/introduction. It should have everything you need to build a basic React application. We highly encourage you, if you are new to React (which is fine) to follow this tutorial and build the example application.

# Getting started
To start, you should make a fork of this repo. As long as you have node and npm installed on your computer, you should be able to do the following:
```
npm install
npm run start
```
This should build all the code in the application and start a server listening on port 8080. If you open your browser to http://localhost:8080 you should see this: "Welcome to Flexisaf Internship". This will mean your environment is set up correctly and you are ready to start coding!
# The mini cbt app
We'd like you to build a basic computer based test application. It should have the following features:

1. Manage exam questions (Admin).
 A predefined admin should be able to login and create multiple choice questions for different subject together with their expected answers
2. Signup (students).
  First Name, Last Name, Phone and email will be Ok. But you can add more fields
3. Take exams (Students)
  Students should be able to login to the app
  View available subjects, then select to take exams for a subject
  Take exams and view result by subject
