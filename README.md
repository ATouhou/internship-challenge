# Flexisaf Internship Challenge
Welcome to the Flexisaf Internship challenge. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build a shopping list application using React. This challenge is based on [this excellent React book and tutorial] (https://www.google.com). It should have everything you need to build a basic React application. We highly encourage you, if you are new to React (which is fine) to follow this tutorial and build the example application.
