# Flexisaf Internship Challenge
Welcome to the Flexisaf Internship challenge. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build a shopping list application using React. This challenge is based on this excellent React book and tutorial http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/introduction. It should have everything you need to build a basic React application. We highly encourage you, if you are new to React (which is fine) to follow this tutorial and build the example application.

# Getting started
To start, you should make a fork of this repo. As long as you have node and npm installed on your computer, you should be able to do the following:
```
npm install
npm run start
```
This should build all the code in the application and start a server listening on port 8080. If you open your browser to http://localhost:8080 you should see this: "Welcome to Flexisaf Internship". This will mean your environment is set up correctly and you are ready to start coding!
# The mini cbt app
We'd like you to build a basic computer based test application. It should have the following features:
1. Allow students to register their basic information. First Name, Last Name, Phone and email will be Ok
2. Login to the app
3.
