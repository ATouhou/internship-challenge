# Flexisaf Internship Challenge
Welcome to the Flexisaf Internship challenge. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build a shopping list application using React. This challenge is based on this excellent React book and tutorial http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/introduction. It should have everything you need to build a basic React application. We highly encourage you, if you are new to React (which is fine) to follow this tutorial and build the example application.
